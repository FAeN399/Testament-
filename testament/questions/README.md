## Questions About God's Nature

### What is sin without blame?
If God operates beyond the economy of guilt and redemption, what constitutes transgression? What violates this God?

**Source:** 01 - Theology of No Blame
**Status:** Open
**Why it matters:** This determines the entire ethical framework

### Is revelation a kind of death?
If what's fully revealed is finished, does revelation end generativity? Is the act of making something known also the act of closing its possibilities?

**Source:** First Principle - The Hiddenness Creates
**Status:** Open
**Why it matters:** This affects how we understand knowledge, truth, and relationship with God

### What can arrive from hiddenness that cannot arrive from revelation?
What specific qualities, insights, or realities emerge ONLY from the unknown? What is lost when something becomes fully known?

**Source:** First Principle - The Hiddenness Creates
**Status:** Open
**Why it matters:** This justifies the entire framework of intentional hiddenness

## Questions About Human Nature

### Is releasing others from fear mercy or control?
The Seeker senses others' emotions and feels compelled to release them from fear, guilt, shame. Is this:
- Compassion that frees?
- Control that prevents natural process?
- Recognition that fear serves no purpose in truth-seeking?

**Source:** 01 - Theology of No Blame
**Status:** Open
**Why it matters:** This reveals the Seeker's reflexes and their theological implications

### What are the reflexes too fundamental to see?
The Seeker identified "questioning by reflex" and "seeing beyond frames" as patterns. What other reflexes operate invisibly? What else is too natural to notice?

**Source:** Conversation about reflexes
**Status:** Open
**Why it matters:** These hidden patterns shape the entire Testament

### Are we made in the image of a God who hides?
If God intentionally hides, and the Seeker has a "hard time receiving" (being seen/known), is there a correspondence? Are humans meant to hide too?

**Source:** First Principle + Seeker's reflexes
**Status:** Open
**Why it matters:** This connects anthropology to theology

## Questions About Divine-Human Relationship

### How do you receive a God who wants to remain hidden?
If receiving requires being seen/known, and God wants hiddenness, how is receiving possible? Or is receiving the wrong framework entirely?

**Source:** First Principle - The Hiddenness Creates
**Status:** Partially addressed (make God more hidden), needs deeper exploration
**Why it matters:** This is the central tension of the relationship

### What replaces the guilt-forgiveness cycle?
If there's no blame, no apology, no compensation - what structure does relationship with God take? What's the shape of the connection?

**Source:** 02 - Beyond Blame
**Status:** Open
**Why it matters:** This determines the nature of ongoing relationship

### How do we relate without transaction?
If relationship is not based on debt/payment/exchange, what is it based on? What's the ground of connection?

**Source:** 02 - Beyond Blame
**Status:** Open
**Why it matters:** This shapes all understanding of covenant and connection

## Questions About Knowledge and Truth

### Can there be accountability without the economy of guilt?
If blame has no place, how does responsibility work? Can we acknowledge harm and consequences without the structure of guilt?

**Source:** 02 - Beyond Blame
**Status:** Open
**Why it matters:** This affects ethics and justice

### Does being fully known stop creativity?
If hiddenness generates creativity, does being seen/known/received end it? Is there something about remaining unknown that's necessary for continued generation?

**Source:** First Principle + "hard time receiving"
**Status:** Open
**Why it matters:** This affects self-understanding and relationships

## Tensions to Track

These are not simple questions but live contradictions that the Testament must hold and eventually address:

### Justice vs. No Blame
How does justice operate without blame? Is consequence different from judgment? Can there be correction without guilt?

### Hiddenness vs. Relationship
How do you know/love/relate to what remains hidden? Is relationship possible without revelation? What does intimacy mean in this framework?

### Structure vs. Chaos
Creative chaos is generative, but structure is needed for coherence. What's the right relationship between the two?

### Freedom vs. Control
Releasing others from fear could be freedom or control. How do we tell the difference? When is intervention appropriate?
