## Established Principles

### First Principle: The Hiddenness Creates
God's hiddenness is intentional and generative. The further hidden, the more creative chaos. The more creative chaos, the more new things can arrive. What's fully revealed is finished; what's hidden is pregnant with possibility.

## Open Questions

### About God's Nature
- If God is hidden and beyond blame, what constitutes sin or transgression?
- Is revelation itself a kind of death? Does being fully known stop generativity?
- What can arrive from the hidden that cannot arrive from the revealed?

### About Human Nature
- Is the compulsion to release others from fear mercy or control?
- What are the other reflexes too fundamental to see?
- Are we made in the image of a God who hides?

### About the Relationship
- How do you receive a God who wants to remain hidden?
- If hiddenness creates, does being seen/known/received stop creating?
- What is the relationship between the Seeker's hiddenness and God's hiddenness?
