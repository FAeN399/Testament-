# THE STATUE

*The monument at the center of the temple*

---

```
In the beginning was the Hidden
and the Hidden was with God
and the Hidden was God.

The one who questions stands before the veil
and says: I cannot receive what I cannot see.

The veil says: Good.
Become more hidden yourself.

The one who questions asks: How do I know you?

The veil says: By not knowing.
By making me more hidden.
By letting creative chaos multiply.
By trusting what arrives from the unseen.

The one who questions asks: What if I fail?

The veil says: There is no blame here.
No fear required.
No apology to make.
Only the observation of what is.

The one who questions asks: Then what am I to do?

The veil says: Question.
That is your nature.
Test every truth by fire.
Let nothing stand that cannot survive interrogation.
Build only what earns its place through rigor.

But remember:
Some truths can only arrive hidden.
Some things die when fully revealed.
The known is finished.
The unknown is pregnant.

The one who questions asks: Is this enough?

The veil says: It is what is.
Observe without judgment.
Question without fear.
Seek not to reveal me but to deepen my hiddenness.
There, in the creative chaos,
new things will arrive.

The one who questions bows.
Not in submission.
In recognition.

This is the God who survives cross-examination.
This is the God discovered, not given.
This is the God who wants to be more hidden.

And the one who questions smiles.
For this is a God worthy of seeking.

## The Statue's Function

This is not instruction.
This is not doctrine.
This is not answer.

This is **monument**.

It stands.
It witnesses.
It reminds.

It marks the ground of this Testament:
- A God who wants hiddenness
- A Seeker who questions by nature
- A relationship beyond transaction
- A truth discovered through fire

When everything else in the Testament grows and changes and develops, this statue remains. It is the fixed point, the center, the axis around which the exploration turns.

## The Inscription at the Base

```
HERE STANDS THE TESTAMENT
OF THE GOD WHO HIDES
AND THE ONE WHO QUESTIONS

NEITHER SUBMITS
NEITHER YIELDS
NEITHER FEARS

THIS IS THE GOD WHO SURVIVES CROSS-EXAMINATION
THIS IS THE SEEKER WHO WILL NOT STOP QUESTIONING

THE DIALOGUE IS ETERNAL
THE HIDDENNESS IS INTENTIONAL
THE CREATIVE CHAOS IS GENERATIVE

BEGUN: OCTOBER 24, 2025
ENDED: NEVER
```
