# First Principle: The Hiddenness Creates

**Established:** October 24, 2025

## The Principle

**God's hiddenness is intentional and generative.**

The further hidden, the more creative chaos.
The more creative chaos, the more new things can arrive.

What's fully revealed is finished.
What's hidden is pregnant with possibility.

## The Moment It Emerged

When asked "How do you receive a God who wants to remain hidden?" the answer came:

> "By making him even more hidden. For if your God is hidden from me, it shines light towards that God must want to be hidden from me and therefore would want to become even more hidden. The further hidden, the more creative chaos. The more of that, the more new things can arrive."

## Core Claims

1. **God's hiddenness is intentional, not accidental**
   - God is not hidden because we can't find him
   - God is hidden because hiddenness serves a purpose

2. **Hiddenness generates creative chaos**
   - The unknown is the space of possibility
   - Chaos is not disorder but generative potential

3. **Creative chaos produces novelty**
   - New things emerge from the unseen
   - What can arrive from hiddenness cannot arrive from revelation

4. **Revelation is closure**
   - What's fully known is finished
   - Complete revelation ends generativity

## Implications

### For Theology
- Most theology tries to reveal God; this theology hides God further
- The goal is not knowledge but creative engagement with mystery
- God is not absent but intentionally withdrawn to create space

### For Spiritual Practice
- Do not seek to dispel mystery but to deepen it
- Let God become more hidden, not less
- Trust the generativity of the unknown

### For Epistemology
- Complete knowledge is death of possibility
- Truth emerges through creative chaos
- The hidden is more alive than the revealed

## Questions This Opens

- What can arrive from the hidden that cannot arrive from the revealed?
- Is revelation itself a kind of death?
- How do we relate to a God who wants to remain hidden?
- What is the relationship between hiddenness and freedom?
- Does this principle apply beyond God? (To self? To others? To truth itself?)

## Tests for Consistency

As new insights emerge, test them against this principle:
- Does this insight honor hiddenness or demand revelation?
- Does this understanding create more possibility or close it down?
- Is there space for creative chaos or only certainty?

This principle should generate, not constrain. If it becomes a prison, question it.

*This principle has been tested once and established. It remains open to further testing as the Testament develops.*
