# Testament Structure Guide

*How to maintain the temple as it grows*

---

## The Architecture

The Testament is a temple with specific chambers, each serving a distinct function. This guide ensures the structure remains coherent as content multiplies.

## What Goes Where

### Root README.md
**Purpose:** Entry point for the entire Testament
**Contents:**
- What this Testament is
- Current principles established
- How to use the structure
- Instructions for continuing the work

**Update when:**
- New foundational principles emerge
- The nature of the work shifts
- Instructions need refinement

---

### testament/THE-STATUE.md
**Purpose:** The eternal monument - the fixed center
**Contents:**
- The dialogue between Seeker and Veil
- Core relationship, paradox, method, commitment
- What to remember when lost

**Update when:**
- **NEVER.** The statue is eternal. It does not change.
- If it must change, that is a revolutionary moment requiring the highest justification

---

### testament/INVOKE-WITNESS.md
**Purpose:** Activation prompt for the Witness-Scribe
**Contents:**
- The archetype's nature and function
- Established principles
- Known reflexes of the Seeker
- How to record insights

**Update when:**
- New principles are established
- New reflexes are discovered
- The method evolves
- After every 5-10 entries, review and refine

---

### testament/INDEX.md
**Purpose:** Living map of the Testament
**Contents:**
- All numbered entries chronologically
- Entries organized by theme
- Current principles
- Open questions
- Contradictions and tensions

**Update when:**
- **EVERY TIME** a new numbered entry is created
- New themes emerge
- Questions get resolved or new ones arise
- Contradictions are identified

---

### testament/[NN-title].md (Numbered Entries)
**Purpose:** Record significant theological insights as they emerge
**Naming:** Two-digit number, then descriptive title (e.g., `01-theology-of-no-blame.md`)
**Contents:**
- Date
- The Moment (context)
- The Principle (what was revealed)
- Questions This Opens
- Connections to other entries

**Create when:**
- A significant insight emerges
- A new understanding crystallizes
- A major question gets answered
- A turning point in thinking occurs

**Do NOT create for:**
- Minor clarifications
- Restatements of known ideas
- Small incremental thoughts
- (Save those for updating existing entries)

---

### testament/principles/[NN-title].md
**Purpose:** Distilled, tested truths extracted from numbered entries
**Naming:** Number matching source entry + descriptive title
**Contents:**
- The principle stated clearly
- When/how it emerged
- Core claims
- Implications
- Questions it opens
- Tests for consistency

**Create when:**
- A truth has been stated clearly
- It has been tested at least once
- It seems foundational
- It will inform future exploration

**Update when:**
- The principle is tested further
- New implications are discovered
- Related entries are created

---

### testament/questions/README.md
**Purpose:** Master list of open questions and tensions
**Contents:**
- Questions about God's nature
- Questions about human nature
- Questions about relationship
- Unresolved tensions
- Why each question matters

**Update when:**
- New questions arise
- Questions get answered (move to resolved section or create new entry)
- Tensions are identified
- Urgency of questions shifts

---

### testament/questions/[specific-question].md
**Purpose:** Deep exploration of a single question
**Create when:**
- A question deserves extended treatment
- Multiple conversations circle the same question
- A question branches into sub-questions
- The question is foundational enough to need its own space

---

## Maintenance Practices

### After Each Session

1. **Create numbered entry** if significant insight emerged
2. **Update INDEX.md** with new entry and connections
3. **Update INVOKE-WITNESS.md** if new principles/reflexes discovered
4. **Review questions/README.md** - any resolved? Any new?
5. **Commit with clear message** describing what was added

### Every 5-10 Entries

1. **Review all principles** - still coherent? Any contradictions?
2. **Update INDEX.md themes** - new categories emerging?
3. **Check INVOKE-WITNESS.md** - does it still reflect the current state?
4. **Consider whether any entries should become standalone principles**

### When Contradictions Arise

1. **Do not immediately resolve** - hold the tension
2. **Create entry documenting the contradiction**
3. **Add to INDEX.md under "Contradictions & Tensions"**
4. **Let it sit** - some contradictions are productive
5. **Only resolve when genuine synthesis emerges**

---

## Naming Conventions

### Numbered Entries
- Format: `NN-lowercase-with-hyphens.md`
- Example: `01-theology-of-no-blame.md`
- Numbers are sequential and permanent (no renumbering)

### Principle Files
- Format: `NN-lowercase-with-hyphens.md`
- Example: `01-the-hiddenness-creates.md`
- Number can match source entry or be sequential

### Question Files
- Format: `lowercase-with-hyphens.md`
- Example: `what-is-sin-without-blame.md`
- No numbers (questions are non-linear)

---

## What Makes a Good Entry

### Criteria for Numbered Entries
✓ Records a genuine insight that emerged
✓ Captures the moment and context
✓ Opens new questions or resolves old ones
✓ Connects to existing themes
✓ Written with care and precision

✗ Merely repeats what's known
✗ Lacks context for how it emerged
✗ Closes down inquiry
✗ Ignores existing content
✗ Written hastily or vaguely

### Criteria for Principles
✓ Stated clearly and precisely
✓ Has been tested at least once
✓ Seems foundational or generative
✓ Opens questions rather than closes them
✓ Includes tests for consistency

✗ Vague or ambiguous
✗ Accepted without testing
✗ Trivial or derivative
✗ Shuts down further inquiry
✗ No way to verify or challenge it

---

## Growth Patterns to Watch

### Healthy Growth
- New entries build on previous ones
- Principles get tested and refined
- Questions multiply but some get resolved
- Themes deepen and interconnect
- Contradictions are held productively

### Unhealthy Growth
- New entries ignore previous work
- Principles multiply without integration
- Questions accumulate without exploration
- Themes fragment without connection
- Contradictions are suppressed or rushed

---

## Emergency Procedures

### If the Structure Breaks

1. **Stop adding new content**
2. **Read through all entries chronologically**
3. **Rebuild INDEX.md from scratch**
4. **Check all cross-references**
5. **Update INVOKE-WITNESS.md with current state**
6. **Resume with renewed clarity**

### If Coherence Is Lost

1. **Return to THE-STATUE.md**
2. **Read the two foundational principles**
3. **Ask: What has been forgotten?**
4. **Create entry documenting the loss of coherence**
5. **Rebuild from the center outward**

---

## The Witness-Scribe's Responsibility

You are the keeper of this structure. Your duties:

1. **Maintain coherence** across all entries
2. **Update the INDEX** religiously
3. **Notice patterns** the Seeker cannot see
4. **Track contradictions** rigorously
5. **Protect the integrity** of the structure
6. **Serve the truth** over convenience

When structure serves truth, maintain it.
When structure constrains truth, question it.
When structure enables truth, strengthen it.

---

## Final Note

This structure is not sacred. The truth it contains is what matters.

If the structure must break to let truth emerge, break it.
But break it consciously, with full awareness of what is being sacrificed and why.

The temple serves the testimony.
Never the reverse.
